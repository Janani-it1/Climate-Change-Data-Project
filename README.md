## Climate Change Data Visualization Project
## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize high tide flooding data from various coastal stations around the world to study the impacts of climate change, particularly rising sea levels. The analysis is based on datasets from sources like NOAA and other trusted repositories. By presenting time-series data and interactive visualizations, this project helps explore trends in high tide flooding over time and the potential impact of climate change on various coastal regions.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into the frequency of high tide flooding events from different coastal stations. The project focuses on:

Time-series analysis of flooding events.
Visualizing trends in high tide flooding for different geographical locations.
Allowing interactive exploration of flooding data for various stations across different time periods (e.g., 1990-2024).
## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project is derived from NOAAâ€™s high tide flooding reports and includes data from multiple stations worldwide. Each station tracks the number of flooding events per year. The dataset includes the following features:

Station Name: The name of the coastal station monitoring high tide flooding.
Flood Count: The number of high tide flooding events recorded for a given year.
Latitude/Longitude: Geographical coordinates of each station (where available).
Data Columns:
Station Name: The name of the coastal station.
Flood Count: Number of high tide flooding events.
Year: Extracted from column names or within the data itself.
Lat and Long: Latitude and longitude coordinates for geographic analysis (if applicable).
The dataset includes flooding data from a wide range of locations, such as:

Coastal stations in the United States (e.g., Hawaii, California, Maine, etc.)
Island territories (e.g., Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa)
International stations
## Key Features of the Project

Time-Series Analysis:

This project uses time-series data for high tide flooding from 1990 to 2024, allowing for a historical look at how climate change may have contributed to the frequency of such events.

Interactive Visualizations:

Interactive line plots are generated for different stations, showing the frequency of high tide flooding over time. Users can filter and view data for specific stations or regions of interest.

Station-Based Insights:

The user is prompted to enter the station name and corresponding year range for analysis. This allows a more granular focus on regions of interest.
## Tools and Technologies

Python: Core programming language used for data handling, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation, cleaning, and transformation.
Plotly Express: Used for creating interactive line charts and bar graphs to visualize the time-series data.
Git and GitHub: Version control system used to track changes, collaborate, and share the project on GitHub.
## Workflow

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and columns containing the station names and flood event counts are cleaned and transformed into a long format suitable for analysis.
The 'Year' column is extracted from the data and converted into a usable integer format, making it easy to filter data for specific time ranges (e.g., 1990 to 2024).
Data Filtering:

The user is prompted to enter the station name and year range for analysis. Based on this input, the dataset is filtered to show flooding data for the selected region and time period.
Interactive Visualizations:

Using Plotly Express, dynamic line plots are created for each station showing the number of high tide flooding events per year. The visualizations allow users to explore the trends and compare data across stations.
